It's hard to define a specific quantity of these ingredients, so instead we'll use ratios. Play by ear how much chimichurri you want to make. As a good rule of thumb, one garlic clove per person served. 

In a bowl, combine 2 parts @parsley, 1 part diced @garlic, 1 part @dried oregano{}, 0.5-1 part @red chili flakes{}, 1 @bay leaf{}, @salt and @pepper to taste, and 3 tablespoons of @olive oil{} to 1 tablespoon of @red wine vinegar{}. 

Serve with any sort of meat or bread.
